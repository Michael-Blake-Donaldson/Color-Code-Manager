COLOR CODE MANAGER

* About
  
This program allows a user to store color codes and create color code templates that they can save for later use.

* Code
  
It runs with a C++ Backend and a Html, CSS, Javascript Frontend.
This program tested by abilities by introducing new libraries.
It also allowed for learning more about blending multiple languages to create a program.
XAML files are new to me so that was a new stepping stone in the progression of this program.

* Analysis
  
This Color Code Manager program can be adapted for use by multiple industries such as Graphic Design, Artists, Makeup Artists, Interior Designers, etc.
I would want to continue to improve the UI/UX of the program to be easier and cleaner for the user.
This personal project was a learning curve with the blend of languages and was a fun challenge!
